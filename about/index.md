I'm Christophe <a title="bé-dar, bay-dar, IPA: /be.daʁ/" style="text-decoration: underline #000 dotted;">Bédard</a>, a master's student in Computer Engineering at Polytechnique Montréal who is passionate about robotics and systems performance. My research interests include performance analysis & debugging of distributed systems in robotics. I have a B.Eng. in Computer Engineering and a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering.

From 2014 to 2019, I was involved in [Élikos](https://elikos.ca/), an engineering student design team working on autonomous drones. We competed in mission 7 of the [International Aerial Robotics Competition](http://www.aerialroboticscompetition.org/) at Georgia Tech in Atlanta, USA. The goal was to autonomously interact with roombas on the ground in order to guide them to a goal line. That had to be done while avoiding obstacles and without any external position sensor. In 2015, with a custom platform, my team ranked first in North America for demonstrating autonomous tracking and following of a ground robot. In 2016, we won the award for Most Innovative Vehicle and ranked second. I led the team from 2017 to 2019.

My other involvements include the [_Association des sociétés techniques de Polytechnique_](https://astp.polymtl.ca/), the _Association Étudiante de Polytechnique_, as well as the _Fonds d'Appui aux Initiatives Étudiantes_, which awards grants to innovative student projects.

### Working experience

* 2019-2020 - **Platform/RTOS Intern, [Apex.AI](https://www.apex.ai/)** (Palo Alto, USA)  
  I worked on a tool for detecting memory allocations and select blocking calls during runtime as part of an ISO 26262 safety certification process.  
  I also worked on integrating tracing into [Apex.OS](https://www.apex.ai/apex-os), as well as adding instrumentation in order to extract run-time information about all layers of the software stack.

* 2019 - **Intern/Praktikant, Bosch** (Renningen, Germany)  
  I worked on open source [tracing tools and instrumentation](https://gitlab.com/ros-tracing/ros2_tracing) for [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/), including [trace data analysis tools](https://gitlab.com/ros-tracing/tracetools_analysis).

* 2018 - **Open Source Developer, Ericsson** (Montréal, Canada)  
  I worked on [Trace Compass](https://www.eclipse.org/tracecompass/), an open source trace viewer and analysis framework ([contributions](https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/owner:cbourquebedard)).

* 2017 - **Intern, [MIST Lab](https://mistlab.ca/), Polytechnique Montréal** (Montréal, Canada)  
  I helped demonstrate swarming behaviour on drones and ground vehicles.
